# Single-Cycle RISC-V CPU in SystemVerilog

This repository contains my lab work for the [Architecture of Processor Systems](https://github.com/MPSU/APS/tree/master) course, focused on building a single-cycle RISC-V CPU using SystemVerilog. The project consists of 12 labs, each focusing on a specific component or stage of designing and implementing a simplified RISC-V processor. The labs progressively build up to a functional single-cycle CPU, covering key concepts in computer architecture and hardware description languages.

***Note:** This repository includes Labs 1 through 12. Labs 13 to 16, which covers peripherals and programming, are not implemented here.*
